I struggled with my database because my ivs were not directly in the database. They still needed to be calculated.
Writing the code for calculating the Ivs was very hard for me. 
I got many errors and therefore used AI/ChatGPT for help. 
I hope this is fine, since I tried my best and spend over 8h on this assignment but still had many errors. 
Since my Ivs are calculated from the raw data and I created a new type of database with calculating, I am open to change the project if needed to and will therefore do it again.
I tried to upload my data in a zip file, because Github tells me the files are too big. I hope this is okay.
