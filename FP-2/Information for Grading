I struggled with my database because my ivs were not directly in database, they still needed to be calculated. This was very hard for me and I used AI/ChatGPT for helping with coding the "new databse / ivs". I hope this is fine, since I tried my best and spend over 8h on this assignment but still had many errors. 
I tried to upload my data in a zip file, bc Github tells me the file is too big.
